XBox 360 Macro used in conjunction with GIMX

1) Load GIMX onto a microcontroller
2) Connect XBox 360 controller to PC (LINUX)
3) Connect AVR (Serial) to PC (LINUX)
4) Run spoof360 and connect AVR (USB) to XBox
5) After spoofing, run macro

Note: This is mainly hardcoded to provide what I need and configured manually to perform different macros.  Only used this to acquire Halo Reach Campaign Commendations.  The long term idea was to add a video input device to leverage computer vision processing along with GIMX.
